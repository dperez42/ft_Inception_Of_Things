# ft_Inception_Of_Things. this is not Internet of Things

This project aims to introduce you to kubernetes from a developer perspective. You will have to set up small clusters and discover the mechanics of continuous integration. At the end of this project you will be able to have a working cluster in docker and have a usable continuous integration for your applications.

This project consists of multiple parts.

>Part one: Create a K3S cluster with two VMs launches and create with Vagrant and one in server mode and the other in agent mode. (a lightweight kubernetes).

>Part two orchestrates multiple apps with kubernetes while using as router an ingress, all inside a VM launched with Vagrant.

>Part three synchronizes github repository and kubernetes' running app with argo-cd's automated sync.

All running in a Virtual Machine, in my case UBUNTU
